# React-Redux with Saga


## Description

This website allows users to view stored movies and update the moviesâ€™ details. Each movie is displayed on DOM with a movie poster, the title, and a small description. By clicking on the movie poster you will be brought to a details page that provides the movie title, genres, and description. An Edit button is provided that will bring the user to the edit page. Here they can update the title and description. Once the user is happy with their changes they can click on the Save button which will update the database. Both the details and edit page allows the user to go to the previous page by clicking the back/cancel button.
